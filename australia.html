	<h1>My Favorite Journey - Visiting Australia</h1>
	<h2>Melbourne</h2>
	<img src="https://www.gostudy.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/melbourne.jpg" alt="melbourne.jpg" width="350" height="200">
	<p>Melbourne, at the head of Port Phillip Bay, is Australia's second largest city and the capital of the south-eastern state of Victoria.<br>
	Serving as Australia’s undisputed cultural capital, Melbourne is bursting with Victorian-era architecture, famed cafés, great bars and restaurants, extensive shopping, museums, galleries, theatres, and large parks and gardens. Its nearly 5-million residents are both multicultural and sports-mad, and the city has year-round festivals, sporting events and the best of Australian culture on display.<br>
	Melbourne is famous as the host city for a range of major international sporting events such as the Australian Open, Melbourne Cup Carnival and Formula 1 Grand Prix. It also features some of the world's most popular art galleries and museums (National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne Museum) and internationally acclaimed festivals (Melbourne International Comedy Festival, Melbourne International Film Festival, Melbourne Fringe Festival). The city is also represented by its world-famous street art, coffee culture, pubs and live music... most of which can be found tucked away in a large number of iconic laneways. Frequently named as the World's Most Liveable City, Melbourne is close to and features many gardens, national parks and areas that are home to some of Australia's iconic wildlife (The Great Ocean Road, Grampians National Park, Phillip Island, Royal Botanic Gardens). Indigenous sites, museums and experiences (Koorie Heritage Trust, Birrarung Marr, Bunjilaka Aboriginal Cultural Centre) maintain a vital link to the people and culture of the First Nations.</p>
	<h2>Sydney</h2>
	<img src="https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2019-06/65830387.jpg" alt="sydney.jpg" width="350" height="200">
	<p>Sydney, city, capital of the state of New South Wales, Australia. Located on Australia’s southeastern coast, Sydney is the country’s largest city and, with its magnificent harbour and strategic position, is one of the most important ports in the South Pacific. In the early 19th century, when it was still a small convict settlement and the first settlers had barely penetrated the interior, it had already established trade with the Pacific Islands, India, China, South Africa, and the Americas.<br>
	The first sight of Sydney, whether from the sea or the air, is always spectacular. Built on low hills surrounding a huge harbour with innumerable bays and inlets, the city is dominated by the bulk of the Sydney Harbour Bridge, one of the longest steel-arch bridges in the world, and the Opera House, with its glittering white shell-shaped roofs that seem to echo the sails of the many yachts in the adjacent harbour. The intricate confusion of water and buildings makes a striking impression either by day or by night.<br>
	Because of its history as a great port and its status as the site of the country’s main international air terminal, Sydney is perhaps the only city in Australia with a genuinely international atmosphere. Yet it remains a very Australian city, with a nice compromise between its British heritage and the South Seas attractions of its climate and environment.
	Sydney is known as the Harbour City. It's the largest, oldest and most cosmopolitan city in Australia with an enviable reputation as one of the world's most beautiful and liveable cities.<br>
	Brimming with history, nature, culture, art, fashion, cuisine, design, Sydney's set next to miles of ocean coastline and sandy surf beaches. Longterm immigration has led to the cities reputation as one of the most culturally and ethnically diverse cities in Australia and the world. The city is also home to the Sydney Opera House and the Sydney Harbour Bridge, two of the most iconic structures on this planet.</p>
	<h2>Gold Coast</h2>

	<p>The Gold Coast is a coastal city in the southeast corner of the state of Queensland in Australia, located between the state capital of Brisbane to the north and the New South Wales state border to the south. The Gold Coast has long been a high-profile tourist destination for Australians and overseas travelers, with Surfers Paradise being the hub of tourist activity.<br>
	The region is famous for its sub-tropical climate, laid-back atmosphere, nightlife, and immaculate sandy beaches. It features immaculate beaches running almost the entire length of the region’s coastline which faces the beautiful blue Pacific Ocean. Match this with a favorable climate, endless attractions, nightlife, dining, friendly people, along with a safe environment, and you have Australias favourite holiday destination that’s open to the world.<br>
	The Gold Coast region is located 70kms south of Queensland’s capital city, Brisbane, and almost 1000km’s north of the capital of New South Wales, Sydney. It has an estimated population of 480,000 and is Australia’s sixth largest city. At the center of the Gold Coast region is the popular and well-known suburb of Surfers Paradise.<br>
	Inland from the beaches and behind the city, there are magnificent National Parks – Springbrook, Lamington, and Tamborine which feature World Heritage protected areas. These scenic sub-tropical rainforests are visitor friendly with picnic areas, short and long nature walks, amazing natural flora and fauna, and spectacular lookouts that gaze out across the hinterland, the city and out to the expanse of the ocean. The Hinterland and Mt Tamborine are also popular for its wineries.</p>
	<h2>Brisbane</h2>

	<p>Brisbane is the capital of the state of Queensland with a population of about 2 million people, making it the third-largest city in Australia.<br>
	Its positive attitude and creative confidence makes Brisbane a genuine new-world city. Even though Brisbane is rapidly developing and forward-thinking, it maintains a youthful enthusiasm and has what is arguably the most vibrant, laid back and friendliest atmosphere of any east-coast capital city.<br>
	Gaining international exposure during the 1982 Commonwealth Games, the 1988 World Expo and the 2001 Goodwill Games, Brisbane's year-round warm climate, spectacular scenery and pleasant locals has been the draw-card for many domestic and international visitors, making Brisbane the fastest-growing city in Australia. In November 2014 the city hosted the G-20 summit, attracting thousands of media, delegates and security staff.</p>
